## 📌 Problem Statement

Many local and community-level problems (such as road damage, waste management issues, water supply problems, or public safety concerns) often go unnoticed or unresolved due to lack of a common platform where people can report, discuss, and collaborate on solutions. We created "SAMADHAN-SOLUTION" to make people collaborate and solve issues .This Bridges the gap between citizens, government, and NGOs for real change.

## 💡 Solution

**Community Problem Solver** is a web-based platform that allows users to:

* Report real-world community problems with a picture
* Categorize issues based on type
* Discuss possible solutions with others
* Issues are solved by people or government
* Upvote important problems to increase visibility
* Downvote if issue is not solved properly

This creates a collaborative, transparent, and community-driven approach to solving real-life problems.
